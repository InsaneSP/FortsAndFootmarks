The historic battle, which took place on the night of 4th February 1670 (Magh Vadya Navami), saw Tanaji's courageous efforts to scale the fort walls with his 500 men. A fierce battle ensued with the Mughal Rajputs, and despite being outnumbered, Tanaji and his men fought valiantly. However, Tanaji Malusare fell in the battle, but his brother, Suryaji Malusare, took charge, rallied the remaining forces, and eventually captured the fort. Upon hearing the news of Tanaji’s death, Shivaji Maharaj famously remarked, 'One fort has been taken, but one fort has been lost.'"
